# WaschbaerDE's - How to Java
Very warm welcome to my newest project which combines the use of Java especially in the IntelliJ-IDE and the use of using Git on Github. Most of the Code won't be worldbreaking or something like this. Mostly I will learn how to structure a programming-task the right way, so fellow programmers also understand the way things are happening and things work together all along. I would be happy if this repository will help me and others.<br>
 **Many informations will be provided in the [Projectwiki](https://github.com/WaschbaerDE/How_To_Java/wiki)**
